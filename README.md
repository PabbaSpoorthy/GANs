Simple implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow for synthetic data generation.
Simple GAN Implementation in PyTorch
Welcome to this simple implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch! This repository contains a straightforward implementation of a GAN trained on a 2D dataset.
What is a GAN?
A GAN consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator learns to generate data that is similar to the training data, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and fake data. They are trained simultaneously in a game-like setting, where the generator tries to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator tries to distinguish real data from fake data.
Getting Started
To get started, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/simple-gan-pytorch.git
Then, navigate to the project directory:

cd simple-gan-pytorch
Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
•	Python 3
•	PyTorch
•	Matplotlib
•	NumPy
You can install the dependencies using pip:
Usage
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can train the GAN by running the script:
python train_gan.py
The script will train the GAN on a sample 2D dataset and generate fake samples. After training, it will display a plot comparing the real and generated data.

Customization
Feel free to customize the GAN by adjusting hyperparameters or modifying the network architectures. You can also use your own dataset by providing a custom data loader.
